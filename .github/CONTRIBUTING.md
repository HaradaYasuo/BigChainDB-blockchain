# How to Contribute to the BigchainDB Project

There are many ways you can contribute to the BigchainDB project, some very easy and others more involved.

All of that is documented elsewhere: go to the "[Contributing to BigchainDB" docs on ReadTheDocs](https://docs.bigchaindb.com/en/latest/). Note: that link goes to the root docs, but you can click from there to get to the "Contributing to BigchainDB" docs, once they get published on ReadTheDocs.

Note: GitHub automatically links to this file (`.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`) when a contributor creates a new issue or pull request, so you shouldn't delete it. Just use it to point people to full and proper help elsewhere.
