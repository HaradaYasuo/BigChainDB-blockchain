There are very few valid reasons to create a pull request. To learn what they are (e.g. a BEP, or a short & specific solution to a well-defined problem), and how to structure the pull request, see the BigchainDB docs about "Contributing to BigchainDB". A link is coming soon. For now, go to:

https://docs.bigchaindb.com/en/latest/

and follow the links from there.
