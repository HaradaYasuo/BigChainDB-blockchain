# Our Release Process

The release process for BigchainDB server differs slightly depending on whether it's a minor or a patch release.

BigchainDB follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) (i.e. MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH), taking into account
that [major version 0.x does not export a stable API](http://semver.org/#spec-item-4).

## Minor release

A minor release is preceeded by a feature freeze and created from the 'master' branch. This is a summary of the steps we go through to release a new minor version of BigchainDB Server.

1. Update the `CHANGELOG.md` file in master
1. Create and checkout a new branch for the release, named after the minor version, without preceeding 'v', ie: `git checkout -b 0.9`
1. Commit changes and push new branch to Github
1. Follow steps outlined in [Common Steps](#common-steps)
1. In 'master' branch, Edit `bigchaindb/version.py`, increment the minor version to the next planned release ie: `0.10.0.dev'.
This is so people reading the latest docs will know that they're for the latest (master branch)
version of BigchainDB Server, not the docs at the time of the most recent release (which are also
available).

Congratulations, you have released BigchainDB!

## Patch release

A patch release is similar to a minor release, but piggybacks on an existing minor release branch:

1. Check out the minor release branch
1. Apply the changes you want, ie using `git cherry-pick`.
1. Update the `CHANGELOG.md` file
1. Increment the patch version in `bigchaindb/version.py`, ie: "0.9.1"
1. Follow steps outlined in [Common Steps](#common-steps)
