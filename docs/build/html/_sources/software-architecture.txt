# BigchainDB Software Architecture

Here we define the components needed for the software implementation of the prototype.

## bigspool

Bigchain implementation of the spool protocol

## bigchain

API to create, read, and push transactions to the bigchain

## validator

Transaction validator. Decides which transactions to include in the bigchain. Each node in the federation will be 
running this code and the a transaction will be valid as long as more then half the nodes decided that the transaction 
is valid

## processor

Creates the blocks from the transactions and cleans the backlog.
