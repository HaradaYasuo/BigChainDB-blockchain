# The Transaction, Block and Vote Models

This page about the data models was getting too big, so it was split into smaller pages. It will be deleted eventually, so update your links. The new pages about the data models can now be found in [the Data Models section of the root BigchainDB docs](https://docs.bigchaindb.com/en/latest/data-models/index.html).
