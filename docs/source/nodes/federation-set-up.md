# How to Set Up a Decentralized BigchainDB Federation

This section outlines the steps to _set up_ a decentralized BigchainDB federation.

If you want to deploy a centrally-controlled BigchainDB cluster on AWS (e.g. for testing), then see [the section about that](deploy-on-aws.html).


## INSERT SUBSECTION TITLE HERE

What kinds of information will the federation store? BigchainDB is well-suited to storing asset registrations and ownership transfers, but it can handle many other kinds of data as well.

How will assets be described? Do you have a data model (schema)? 

Who (or what organizations) will run the nodes?
