# The HTTP Client-Server API

The preferred way to communicate with a node in a BigchainDB cluster is via HTTP requests. Each node exposes a simple HTTP API (the HTTP Client-Server API) that provides, right now, two endpoints, one to get information about a specific transaction id, and one to push a transaction to the BigchainDB cluster.

The endpoints are documented using [Apiary](http://docs.bigchaindb.apiary.io/).
