# Introduction

BigchainDB is a scalable blockchain database. You can read about its motivations, goals and high-level architecture in the [BigchainDB whitepaper](https://www.bigchaindb.com/whitepaper/). This document, the _BigchainDB Documentation_, is intended primarily for three groups of people:

1. Developers of BigchainDB server software and related software (e.g. BigchainDB drivers/SDKs).
2. People deploying and managing BigchainDB clusters.
3. App developers who are developing client apps to talk to one or more live, operational BigchainDB clusters. They would use one of the BigchainDB drivers/SDKs.

Right now, BigchainDB is fairly new, so there are no live, operational BigchainDB clusters. There are no BigchainDB drivers. Those things are coming.

What does exist is our in-development BigchainDB server software. Therefore all the documentation is about that, for now.
