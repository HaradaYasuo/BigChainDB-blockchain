# Backing Up & Restoring Data

There are several ways to backup and restore the data in a BigchainDB cluster.


## Replication is a form of Backup

RethinkDB already has internal replication: every document is stored on _R_ different nodes, where _R_ is the replication factor (set using `bigchaindb set-replicas R`). Those replicas can be thought of as "live backups" because if one node goes down, the cluster will continue to work and no data will be lost.


## rethinkdb dump (to a File)

RethinkDB can create an archive of all data in the cluster (or all data in specified tables), as a compressed file. According to [the RethinkDB blog post when that functionality became available](https://rethinkdb.com/blog/1.7-release/):

> Since the backup process is using client drivers, it automatically takes advantage of the MVCC [multiversion concurrency control] functionality built into RethinkDB. It will use some cluster resources, but will not lock out any of the clients, so you can safely run it on a live cluster.

To back up all the data in a BigchainDB cluster, the RethinkDB admin user must run a command like the following on one of the nodes:
```text
rethinkdb dump -e bigchain.bigchain -e bigchain.votes
```

That should write a file named `rethinkdb_dump_<date>_<time>.tar.gz`. The `-e` option is used to specify which tables should be exported. You probably don't need to export the backlog table, but you definitely need to export the bigchain and votes tables. 
`bigchain.votes` means the `votes` table in the RethinkDB database named `bigchain`. It's possible that your database has a different name: [the database name is a BigchainDB configuration setting](../nodes/configuration.html#database-host-database-port-database-name). The default name is `bigchain`. (Tip: you can see the values of all configuration settings using the `bigchaindb show-config` command.)

There's [more information about the `rethinkdb dump` command in the RethinkDB documentation](https://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/backup/). It also explains how to restore data to a cluster from an archive file.

**Notes**

* If the `rethinkdb dump` subcommand fails and the last line of the Traceback says "NameError: name 'file' is not defined", then you need to update your RethinkDB Python driver; do a `pip install --upgrade rethinkdb`

* It can take a very long time to backup data this way. The more data, the longer it will take.

* You need enough free disk space to store the backup file.

* If a document changes after the backup starts but before it ends, then the changed document may not be in the final backup. This shouldn't be a problem for BigchainDB, because blocks and votes can't change anyway.

* `rethinkdb dump` saves data and secondary indexes, but does *not* save cluster metadata. You will need to recreate your cluster setup yourself after you run `rethinkdb restore`.

* RethinkDB also has [subcommands to import/export](https://gist.github.com/coffeemug/5894257) collections of JSON or CSV files. While one could use those for backup/restore, it wouldn't be very practical.


## Backup by Copying RethinkDB Data Files

It's _possible_ to back up a BigchainDB database by creating a copy of the RethinkDB data files (on all nodes, at roughly the same time). If you're curious about what's involved, see the [MongoDB documentation about "Backup by Copying Underlying Data Files"](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/backups/#backup-with-file-copies). (Yes, that's documentation for MongoDB, but the principles are the same.)


## Client-Side Backup

In the future, it will be possible for clients to query for the blocks containing the transactions they care about, and for the votes on those blocks. They could save a local copy of those blocks and votes.

**How could we be sure blocks and votes from a client are valid?**

All blocks and votes are signed by federation nodes. Only federation nodes can produce valid signatures because only federation nodes have the necessary private keys. A client can't produce a valid signature for a block or vote.

**Could we restore an entire BigchainDB database using client-saved blocks and votes?**

Yes, in principle, but it would be difficult to know if you've recovered every block and vote. Votes link to the block they're voting on and to the previous block, so one could detect some missing blocks. It would be difficult to know if you've recovered all the votes.


## Incremental or Continuous Backup

**Incremental backup** is where backup happens on a regular basis (e.g. daily), and each one only records the changes since the last backup.

**Continuous backup** might mean incremental backup on a very regular basis (e.g. every ten minutes), or it might mean backup of every database operation as it happens. The latter is also called transaction logging or continuous archiving.

RethinkDB doesn't have a built-in incremental or continuous backup capability. Incremental backup was mentioned briefly in RethinkDB Issue [#89](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/89).

To get a sense of what continuous backup might look like for RethinkDB, one can look at the continuous backup options available for MongoDB. MongoDB, the company, offers continuous backup with [Ops Manager](https://www.mongodb.com/products/ops-manager) (self-hosted) or [Cloud Manager](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud) (fully managed). Features include:

* It "continuously maintains backups, so if your MongoDB deployment experiences a failure, the most recent backup is only moments behind..."
* It "offers point-in-time backups of replica sets and cluster-wide snapshots of sharded clusters. You can restore to precisely the moment you need, quickly and safely."
* "You can rebuild entire running clusters, just from your backups."
* It enables, "fast and seamless provisioning of new dev and test environments."

The MongoDB documentation has more [details about how Ops Manager Backup works](https://docs.opsmanager.mongodb.com/current/application/#backup).

Considerations for BigchainDB:

* We'd like the cost of backup to be low. To get a sense of the cost, MongoDB Cloud Manager backup [costed $30 / GB / year prepaid](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/lower-mms-backup-prices-backing-mongodb-now-easier-and-more-affordable). One thousand gigabytes backed up (i.e. about a terabyte) would cost 30 thousand US dollars per year. (That's just for the backup; there's also a cost per server per year.)
* We'd like the backup to be decentralized, with no single point of control or single point of failure. (Note: some file systems have a single point of failure. For example, HDFS has one Namenode.)
* We only care to back up blocks and votes, and once written, those never change. There are no updates or deletes, just new blocks and votes.

This is a first draft; we'll have more to say here in the future.
