# Production-Ready?

BigchainDB is not production-ready. You can use it to build a prototype or proof-of-concept (POC); many people are already doing that.
Once BigchainDB is production-ready, we'll make an announcement.

BigchainDB version numbers follow the conventions of *Semantic Versioning* as documented at [semver.org](http://semver.org/). (For Python stuff, we use [Python's version of Semantic Versioning](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/distributing-packages/#choosing-a-versioning-scheme).) This means, among other things:

* Before version 1.0, breaking API changes could happen in any new version, even in a change from version 0.Y.4 to 0.Y.5.

* Starting with version 1.0.0, breaking API changes will only happen when the MAJOR version changes (e.g. from 1.7.4 to 2.0.0, or from 4.9.3 to 5.0.0).

To review the release history of some particular BigchainDB software, go to the GitHub repository of that software and click on "Releases". For example, the release history of BigchainDB Server can be found at [https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/releases](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/releases).

[The BigchainDB Roadmap](https://github.com/bigchaindb/org/blob/master/ROADMAP.md) will give you a sense of the things we intend to do with BigchainDB in the near term and the long term.
