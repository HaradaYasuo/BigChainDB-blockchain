# BigchainDB and Byzantine Fault Tolerance

While BigchainDB is not currently [Byzantine fault tolerant (BFT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance), we plan to offer it as an option.
We anticipate that turning it on will cause a severe dropoff in performance. See [Issue #293](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/issues/293).

In the meantime, there are practical things that one can do to increase security (e.g. firewalls, key management, and access controls).
