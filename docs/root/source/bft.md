# BigchainDB and Byzantine Fault Tolerance

While BigchainDB is not currently [Byzantine fault tolerant (BFT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance), we plan to offer it as an option. 
Update Nov 2017: we're actively working on this, the next release or two will likely have support. More details to come in blog form and github issues

Related issue: [Issue #293](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/issues/293). We anticipate that turning on BFT will cause a dropoff in performance (for a gain in security).

In the meantime, there are practical things that one can do to increase security (e.g. firewalls, key management, and access controls).
