Kubernetes Template: Add a BigchainDB Node to an Existing BigchainDB Cluster
============================================================================

This page describes how to deploy a BigchainDB node using Kubernetes,
and how to add that node to an existing BigchainDB cluster.
It assumes you already have a running Kubernetes cluster
where you can deploy the new BigchainDB node.

If you want to deploy the first BigchainDB node in a BigchainDB cluster,
or a stand-alone BigchainDB node,
then see :doc:`the page about that <node-on-kubernetes>`.


Terminology Used
----------------

``existing cluster`` will refer to one of the existing Kubernetes clusters
hosting one of the existing BigchainDB nodes.

``ctx-1`` will refer to the kubectl context of the existing cluster.

``new cluster`` will refer to the new Kubernetes cluster that will run a new
BigchainDB node (including a BigchainDB instance and a MongoDB instance).

``ctx-2`` will refer to the kubectl context of the new cluster.

``new MongoDB instance`` will refer to the MongoDB instance in the new cluster.

``existing MongoDB instance`` will refer to the MongoDB instance in the
existing cluster.

``new BigchainDB instance`` will refer to the BigchainDB instance in the new
cluster.

``existing BigchainDB instance`` will refer to the BigchainDB instance in the
existing cluster.

Below, we refer to multiple files by their directory and filename,
such as ``mongodb/mongo-ext-conn-svc.yaml``. Those files are files in the
`bigchaindb/bigchaindb repository on GitHub
<https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/>`_ in the ``k8s/`` directory.
Make sure you're getting those files from the appropriate Git branch on
GitHub, i.e. the branch for the version of BigchainDB that your BigchainDB
cluster is using.


Step 1: Prerequisites
---------------------

* :ref:`List of all the things to be done by each node operator <things-each-node-operator-must-do>`.

* The public key should be shared offline with the other existing BigchainDB
  nodes in the existing BigchainDB cluster.

* You will need the public keys of all the existing BigchainDB nodes.

* A new Kubernetes cluster setup with kubectl configured to access it.

* Some familiarity with deploying a BigchainDB node on Kubernetes.
  See our :doc:`other docs about that <node-on-kubernetes>`.

Note: If you are managing multiple Kubernetes clusters, from your local
system, you can run ``kubectl config view`` to list all the contexts that
are available for the local kubectl.
To target a specific cluster, add a ``--context`` flag to the kubectl CLI. For
example:

.. code:: bash

   $ kubectl --context ctx-1 apply -f example.yaml
   $ kubectl --context ctx-2 apply -f example.yaml
   $ kubectl --context ctx-1 proxy --port 8001
   $ kubectl --context ctx-2 proxy --port 8002


Step 2: Configure the BigchainDB Node

--------------------------------

Please see the following section:

* :ref:`start-the-nginx-service`.


Step 4: Assign DNS Name to the NGINX Public IP
----------------------------------------------

Please see the following section:

* :ref:`assign-dns-name-to-the-nginx-public-ip`.


Step 5: Start the MongoDB Kubernetes Service

Please see the following section:

* :ref:`start-the-nginx-kubernetes-deployment`.


Step 9: Create Kubernetes Storage Classes for MongoDB
-----------------------------------------------------

Please see the following section:

* :ref:`create-kubernetes-storage-classes-for-mongodb`.


Step 10: Create Kubernetes Persistent Volume Claims
---------------------------------------------------

Please see the following section:

* :ref:`create-kubernetes-persistent-volume-claims`.


Step 11: Start a Kubernetes StatefulSet for MongoDB
---------------------------------------------------

Please see the following section:

* :ref:`start-a-kubernetes-statefulset-for-mongodb`.


Step 12: Verify network connectivity between the MongoDB instances
------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure your MongoDB instances can access each other over the network. *If* you are deploying
the new MongoDB node in a different cluster or geographical location using Azure Kubernetes Container
Service, you will have to set up networking between the two clusters using `Kubernetes
Services <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/>`_.

Assuming we have an existing MongoDB instance ``mdb-instance-0`` residing in Azure data center location ``westeurope`` and we
want to add a new MongoDB instance ``mdb-instance-1`` located in Azure data center location ``eastus`` to the existing MongoDB
replica set. Unless you already have explicitly set up networking for ``mdb-instance-0`` to communicate with ``mdb-instance-1`` and
vice versa, we will have to add a Kubernetes Service in each cluster to accomplish this goal in order to set up a
MongoDB replica set.
It is similar to ensuring that there is a ``CNAME`` record in the DNS
infrastructure to resolve ``mdb-instance-X`` to the host where it is actually available.
We can do this in Kubernetes using a Kubernetes Service of ``type``
``ExternalName``.

* This configuration is located in the file ``mongodb/mongo-ext-conn-svc.yaml``.

* Set the name of the ``metadata.name`` to the host name of the MongoDB instance you are trying to connect to.
  For instance if you are configuring this service on cluster with ``mdb-instance-0`` then the ``metadata.name`` will
  be ``mdb-instance-1`` and vice versa.

* Set ``spec.ports.port[0]`` to the ``mongodb-backend-port`` from the ConfigMap for the other cluster.

* Set ``spec.externalName`` to the FQDN mapped to NGINX Public IP of the cluster you are trying to connect to.
  For more information about the FQDN please refer to: :ref:`assign-dns-name-to-the-nginx-public-ip`.

.. note::
   This operation needs to be replicated ``n-1`` times per node for a ``n`` node cluster, with the respective FQDNs
   we need to communicate with.

   If you are not the system administrator of the cluster, you have to get in
   touch with the system administrator/s of the other ``n-1`` clusters and
   share with them your instance name (``mdb-instance-name`` in the ConfigMap)
   and the FQDN for your node (``cluster-fqdn`` in the ConfigMap).


Step 13: Add the New MongoDB Instance to the Existing Replica Set
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Note that by ``replica set``, we are referring to the MongoDB replica set,
not a Kubernetes' ``ReplicaSet``.

If you are not the administrator of an existing BigchainDB node, you
will have to coordinate offline with an existing administrator so that they can
add the new MongoDB instance to the replica set.

Add the new instance of MongoDB from an existing instance by accessing the
``mongo`` shell and authenticate as the ``adminUser`` we created for existing MongoDB instance OR
contact the admin of the PRIMARY MongoDB node:

.. code:: bash

   $ kubectl --context ctx-1 exec -it <existing mongodb-instance-name> bash
   $ mongo --host <existing mongodb-instance-name> --port 27017 --verbose --ssl \
     --sslCAFile /etc/mongod/ssl/ca.pem \
     --sslPEMKeyFile /etc/mongod/ssl/mdb-instance.pem

   PRIMARY> use admin
   PRIMARY> db.auth("adminUser", "superstrongpassword")

One can only add members to a replica set from the ``PRIMARY`` instance.
The ``mongo`` shell prompt should state that this is the primary member in the
replica set.
If not, then you can use the ``rs.status()`` command to find out who the
primary is and login to the ``mongo`` shell in the primary.

Run the ``rs.add()`` command with the FQDN and port number of the other instances:

.. code:: bash

   PRIMARY> rs.add("<new mdb-instance-name>:<port>")


Step 14: Verify the Replica Set Membership
------------------------------------------

You can use the ``rs.conf()`` and the ``rs.status()`` commands available in the
mongo shell to verify the replica set membership.

The new MongoDB instance should be listed in the membership information
displayed.


Step 15: Configure Users and Access Control for MongoDB
-------------------------------------------------------

* Create the users in MongoDB with the appropriate roles assigned to them. This
  will enable the new BigchainDB instance, new MongoDB Monitoring Agent
  instance and the new MongoDB Backup Agent instance to function correctly.

* Please refer to
  :ref:`configure-users-and-access-control-for-mongodb` to create and
  configure the new BigchainDB, MongoDB Monitoring Agent and MongoDB Backup
  Agent users on the cluster.

.. note::
   You will not have to create the MongoDB replica set or create the admin user, as they already exist.

   If you do not have access to the ``PRIMARY`` member of the replica set, you
   need to get in touch with the administrator who can create the users in the
   MongoDB cluster.



Step 16: Start a Kubernetes Deployment for MongoDB Monitoring Agent
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Please see the following section:

* :ref:`start-a-kubernetes-deployment-for-mongodb-monitoring-agent`.

.. note::
   Every MMS group has only one active Monitoring and Backup Agent and having
   multiple agents provides high availability and failover, in case one goes
   down. For more information about Monitoring and Backup Agents please
   consult the `official MongoDB documenation
   <https://docs.cloudmanager.mongodb.com/tutorial/move-agent-to-new-server/>`_.


Step 17: Start a Kubernetes Deployment for MongoDB Backup Agent
---------------------------------------------------------------

Please see the following section:

* :ref:`start-a-kubernetes-deployment-for-mongodb-backup-agent`.

.. note::
   Every MMS group has only one active Monitoring and Backup Agent and having
   multiple agents provides high availability and failover, in case one goes
   down. For more information about Monitoring and Backup Agents please
   consult the `official MongoDB documenation
   <https://docs.cloudmanager.mongodb.com/tutorial/move-agent-to-new-server/>`_.


Step 18: Start a Kubernetes Deployment for BigchainDB
-----------------------------------------------------

* Set ``metadata.name`` and ``spec.template.metadata.labels.app`` to the
  value set in ``bdb-instance-name`` in the ConfigMap, followed by
  ``-dep``.
  For example, if the value set in the
  ``bdb-instance-name`` is ``bdb-instance-0``, set the fields to the
  value ``bdb-instance-0-dep``.

* Set the value of ``BIGCHAINDB_KEYPAIR_PRIVATE`` (not base64-encoded).
  (In the future, we'd like to pull the BigchainDB private key from
  the Secret named ``bdb-private-key``, but a Secret can only be mounted as a file,
  so BigchainDB Server would have to be modified to look for it
  in a file.)

* As we gain more experience running BigchainDB in testing and production,
  we will tweak the ``resources.limits`` values for CPU and memory, and as
  richer monitoring and probing becomes available in BigchainDB, we will
  tweak the ``livenessProbe`` and ``readinessProbe`` parameters.

* Set the ports to be exposed from the pod in the
  ``spec.containers[0].ports`` section. We currently expose 2 ports -
  ``bigchaindb-api-port`` and ``bigchaindb-ws-port``. Set them to the
  values specified in the ConfigMap.

* Uncomment the env var ``BIGCHAINDB_KEYRING``, it will pick up the
  ``:`` delimited list of all the public keys in the BigchainDB cluster from the ConfigMap.

Create the required Deployment using:

.. code:: bash

   $ kubectl --context ctx-2 apply -f bigchaindb-dep.yaml

You can check its status using the command ``kubectl --context ctx-2 get deploy -w``


Step 19: Restart the Existing BigchainDB Instance(s)
----------------------------------------------------

* Add the public key of the new BigchainDB instance to the ConfigMap
  ``bdb-keyring`` variable of all the existing BigchainDB instances.
  Update all the existing ConfigMap using:

.. code:: bash

   $ kubectl --context ctx-1 apply -f configuration/config-map.yaml

* Uncomment the ``BIGCHAINDB_KEYRING`` variable from the
  ``bigchaindb/bigchaindb-dep.yaml`` to refer to the keyring updated in the
  ConfigMap.
  Update the running BigchainDB instance using:

.. code:: bash

   $ kubectl --context ctx-1 delete -f bigchaindb/bigchaindb-dep.yaml
   $ kubectl --context ctx-1 apply -f bigchaindb/bigchaindb-dep.yaml


See the page titled :ref:`how-to-configure-a-bigchaindb-node`
for more information about ConfigMap configuration.

You can SSH to an existing BigchainDB instance and run the ``bigchaindb
show-config`` command to check that the keyring is updated.


Step 20: Start a Kubernetes Deployment for OpenResty
----------------------------------------------------

Please see the following section:

* :ref:`start-a-kubernetes-deployment-for-openresty`.


Step 21: Configure the MongoDB Cloud Manager
--------------------------------------------

* MongoDB Cloud Manager auto-detects the members of the replica set and
  configures the agents to act as a master/slave accordingly.

* You can verify that the new MongoDB instance is detected by the
  Monitoring and Backup Agent using the Cloud Manager UI.


Step 22: Test Your New BigchainDB Node
--------------------------------------

* Please refer to the testing steps :ref:`here
  <verify-the-bigchaindb-node-setup>` to verify that your new BigchainDB
  node is working as expected.
