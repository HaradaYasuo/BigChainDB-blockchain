# Production Node Assumptions

Be sure you know the key BigchainDB terminology:

* [BigchainDB node, BigchainDB cluster and BigchainDB consortum](https://docs.bigchaindb.com/en/latest/terminology.html)
* [dev/test node, bare-bones node and production node](../introduction.html)

We make some assumptions about production nodes:

1. Production nodes use MongoDB, not RethinkDB.
1. Each production node is set up and managed by an experienced professional system administrator or a team of them.
1. Each production node in a cluster is managed by a different person or team.

You can use RethinkDB when building prototypes, but we don't advise or support using it in production.

We don't provide a detailed cookbook explaining how to secure a server, or other things that a sysadmin should know. (We do provide some [templates](../cloud-deployment-templates/index.html), but those are just a starting point.)
