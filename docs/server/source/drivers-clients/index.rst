Libraries and Tools Maintained by the BigchainDB Team

* `The Python Driver <https://docs.bigchaindb.com/projects/py-driver/en/latest/index.html>`_
* `The Transaction CLI <https://docs.bigchaindb.com/projects/cli/en/latest/>`_ is
  a command-line interface for building BigchainDB transactions.
  You may be able to call it from inside the language of
  your choice, and then use :ref:`the HTTP API <The HTTP Client-Server API>`
  to post transactions.
