# Write a Bug Report

1. Go to the repository with the source code for the bug. Possibilities include:

   - [BigchainDB Server](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb)
   - [BigchainDB Python Driver](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb-driver)
   - [BigchainDB JavaScript Driver](https://github.com/bigchaindb/js-bigchaindb-driver)
   - [cryptoconditions](https://github.com/bigchaindb/cryptoconditions) (a Python package by us)
   - [py-abci](https://github.com/davebryson/py-abci) (a Python package we use)

1. Click on the **Issues** tab.
1. Click the button to create a **New Issue**.
1. Describe everything in detail:

   - What computer are you on (hardware)
   - What operating system are you using, including version. e.g. Ubuntu 14.04? Fedora 23? If it's not a Linux distro, then that's probably the problem.
   - What version of BigchainDB software were you using? Did you update it to the latest?
   - What, exactly, did you do to get to the point where you got stuck? Describe all the steps so we can get there too.
   - Show screenshots or copy-and-paste text to GitHub
   - Say what you expected to happen
   - Show what actually happened
   - Say what you tried to do to resolve the problem
   - Provide details to convince us that it matters to you. Is it for a school project, a job, a contract with a deadline, a child who needs it for Christmas?

We will do our best but please understand that we don't have time to help everyone, especially people who don't care to help us help them. "It doesn't work." is not going to get any reaction from us. We need _details_.
