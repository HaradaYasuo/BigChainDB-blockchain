# Write a BigchaindB Enhancement Proposal (BEP)

This is what you do if you want to request a new feature or a change in how BigchainDB works. The more clearly you write,
the better chance you have of convincing us that it's easy and worth doing.

1. Review [2/COSS](https://github.com/bigchaindb/BEPs/tree/master/2). Maybe print it for reference.
1. Folowing those guidelines, make a pull request against the [bigchaindb/BEPs](https://github.com/bigchaindb/BEPs) repository on GitHub.
1. Don't spend weeks on this. Version 1 should take a few hours to write up, maximum. You can add to it in the future. The process is iterative.
   If you need more than a few hours, then consider writing multiple BEPs.
