# Updating from BigchainDB v0.10 to v1.0

BigchainDB v1.0 stands for backwards compatibility. This means that all
following [minor](http://semver.org/) releases after version 1.0 will always be
backwards-compatible to previous versions.

For all future releases, we commit to not introduce breaking changes to the
public interfaces of BigchainDB's:

- [Data
  model](https://docs.bigchaindb.com/projects/server/en/latest/data-models/index.html)
- [HTTP
  API](https://docs.bigchaindb.com/projects/server/en/latest/http-client-server-api.html)
- [WebSocket Event Stream
  API](https://docs.bigchaindb.com/projects/server/en/latest/websocket-event-stream-api.html)
- [official Python driver](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb-driver)
- [official Javascript
  driver](https://github.com/bigchaindb/js-bigchaindb-driver)


As we saw the version bump to v1.0 as our last chance in a while to fix minor
annoyances, we intentionally did clean up on the above interfaces.  In this
document, we'd like to give a comprehensive summary of those changes to allow
you to upgrade efficiently.

The next sections will go over each of the above mentioned interfaces and
detail the exact changes.

### Syntactical changes

#### `txid` and `tx_id` becomes `transaction_id`

To establish better consistency between external interfaces, all usages of
`txid` and `tx_id` in data models and HTTP API were renamed to
`transaction_id`.


### Changes to the Data Model

#### Output amount is now a string

BigchainDB transactions may have multiple inputs and outputs, and each output
has an amount, which is the integral number of the asset being transferred. In
prior versions of BigchainDB, the amount was encoded as a number, which on the
face of it is the obvious way to encode an integer. However, as usual the devil
is in the details; JSON, the encoding of choice for BigchainDB transactions,
encodes all numbers including integers as floating point. This isn't a problem
for the majority of circumstances where numbers are small, however in some
environments and for some use cases\*, the number may lose precision.

In order to safeguard against this, amounts are now encoded as strings, and it
is recommended to use a decimal math library (such as
[big.js](https://github.com/MikeMcl/big.js)) when dealing with large numbers in
Javascript. Additionally, numbers are capped at 9e18 to stay comfortably within
the boundary of a 64 bit signed integer.

\* Try this in the Chrome developer console: `2**60 == 2**60+1`.


#### Input `fulfills.txid` is now `transaction_id`

We renamed a TRANSFER transaction's `inputs.fulfills.txid` to
`inputs.fulfills.transaction_id`.


#### Signing payload is now the transaction body

The signature payload of a BigchainDB transaction is now "just" the JSON
serialized body of the transaction. This change is invisible to applications
that do not produce transactions with more than one input. However, prior to
the 1.0 release, transactions with multiple inputs had a special signing
protocol, which included reassembly of the transaction. This was identified as
being unneeded, so now the payload that is signed is always just the serialized
transaction, minus signatures. More details, take a look at the
[Pull-Request](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1225) introducing
the change or at our updated [Handcrafting
Transactions](https://docs.bigchaindb.com/projects/py-driver/en/latest/handcraft.html)
document.


#### Update to Cryptoconditions version 2

Earlier the IETF Interledger working group released an [updated
draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-thomas-crypto-conditions-02) of their
Crypto-Conditions specification. To send transactions to BigchainDB v1.0, all
transaction's inputs and outputs need to comply to this new version.

Several of the language specific implementations have already been updated,
including:

- [py-crypto-conditions](https://github.com/bigchaindb/cryptoconditions)
- [js-crypto-conditions](https://github.com/interledgerjs/five-bells-condition)
- [java-crypto-conditions](https://github.com/interledger/java-crypto-conditions)
