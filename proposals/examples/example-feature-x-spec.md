## Feature X: Design specification document

Introduction paragraph - A simple explanation of what are we trying to accomplish with this feature.
Should be simple enough that even novice users/developers can understand. Ideally, this paragraph
should be made part of the feature PR(Pull Request).

  * If you want to provide a diagram with your specification document, please use
    ascii diagrams (plain text).
    
    * [asciiflow](http://asciiflow.com/) is a good tool to get started.

  * **TODO:** We will add more guidelines on the formatting later.
